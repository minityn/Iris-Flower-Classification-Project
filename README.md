# Iris Flower Classification Project
 Iris Flower Classification for Internship
I'm excited to share a recent project that dives into predicting the species of Iris flowers using Machine Learning algorithms. 🌼🌸

🛠️ Technologies Used:
👉 Python
👉 Pandas
👉 NumPy
👉 Scikit-learn
👉 Seaborn
👉 XGBoost

📚 Project Overview:
👉 Data Loading: The Iris dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for ease of manipulation.

👉 Data Exploration: Initial data exploration was conducted using DataPrep's EDA library to generate comprehensive reports and Pandas' describe() for statistical summaries.

👉 Data Preprocessing: Label Encoding was applied to convert species names into numerical labels.

👉 Feature and Label Extraction: Features and labels were carefully selected to ensure the best predictive outcome.

📊 Data Visualization:
👉 Used Seaborn to visualize the distributions of various features, providing valuable insights into the data.

🤖 Machine Learning Models:
👉 Logistic Regression
👉 Decision Tree Classifier
👉 Random Forest Classifier
👉 Extra Trees Classifier
👉 XGBoost Classifier

Each model was trained and evaluated using a custom classify function that also performed cross-validation to ensure robustness.

📈 What's Next?
👉 Adding hyperparameter tuning
👉 Incorporating error handling
👉 Expanding the project to include other datasets

🤝 I'm open to collaborations or discussions around this exciting project. If you're interested, feel free to connect or drop a comment below.
